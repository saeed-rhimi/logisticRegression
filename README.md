# Logistic Regression Project

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based implementation of a logistic regression model. It utilizes a dataset `Social_Network_Ads.csv` to demonstrate the application of logistic regression in binary classification tasks. The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook and covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. The project also depends on several Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells in sequence to see the process of data loading, preprocessing, logistic regression model training, and evaluation.
